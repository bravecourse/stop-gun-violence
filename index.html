<p>MY NAME IS ERIC CRUTCHFIELD IAM FROM WASHINGTON DC I GROW UP IN SE IAM A FATHER OF 7 I LOVE SPAINDING TIME WITH MY FAIMLY AND FRIENDS READING AND WORKING OUT HELPS THE MIND BODY SOUL.....WHILE THE PACE ON GUN VIOLENCE IN AND AROUND SCHOOLS IS ON THE RISE ONE OF THE MOST AGGRESSIVE AND EFFECTIVE EFFORTS LED LARGLY BY BLACK CONSERVATIVES IN SHAPING THE AMERICAN CLASSROOMS. GUN VIOLENCE IN OUR CITY SHOULD BE TOP PRIORITY BECAUSE THE HOMICIDES OF OUR CHILDREN BY FIREARM IN AND AROUND OUR CITY HAS ROSE TO MORE THAN 40%BETWEEN 20021 AND 20022. OUR CHILDREN ARE NOT SAFE AT SCHOOL OR AT HOME BACK IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR A YOUNG BOY WAS SHOT TWO BLOCKS FROM HIS HOME LOCATED ON 13TH AND COLUMBIA ROAD NW .ALSO IN APRIL A LITTLE GIRL WAS GRAZED BY ONE BULLET FIRED BY A SNIPER WHILE SHE WAS AT SCHOOL PEOPLE TAKE THE GUN VIOLENCE AS A JOKE ITS AN EPIDEMIC LIKE COVID 19 .AS OF APRIL 29 20022 ITS ALREADY 57 HOMICIDES OVER 440 ASSAULTS WITH DANGEROUS WEAPONS AND 783 ROBBERIES. ALL MOST EVERYBODY IN OUR CITY KNOWS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN IN JAIL .ROBBED SHOT STABBED OR KNOW WHERE TO FIND A GUN.SPEAKING AMONG THE GROUP WE KNOW OVER 100 PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR LIFE TO GUN VIOLENCE WE FEEL LIKE IF WE HAD MORE BIG BROTHER PROGRAMS FOR THE KIDS THINGS WOULD BE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THE KIDS WOULD HAVE MORE FUN ACTIVITIES VERSUS BEING IN THE STREET .ALSO WE THINK THEY SHOULD BRING BACK THE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB .THE YOUTH NEED TO HAVE MORE HANDS ON DECK MORE MENTORS COUNSELING MORE FAMILIES NEED TO GET INVOLVED. CLEAN UP TIME MOST OF OUR YOUTH HAS BEEN THROUGH TRAUMA AT SOME POINT IN THEIR LIFE MOST KIDS ARE AFRAID TO TELL SOMEONE HOW THEY FEEL WHAT THEY BEEN THROUGH OR WHATS ON THEIR MIND.TRAUMA COMES IN MANY FORMS SUCH AS PTSD. LOST OF A LOVED ONE .SEXUAL MOLESTATION AND SOME HAVE NO FAMILY SUPPORT. IAM A SURVIVOR OF GUN VIOLENCE OUR CHILDREN ARE THE FUTURE EVERY ONE MUST STAND UP IF WE STOP THE KILLING WE SAVE OUR FUTURE .SUMMARY I PICKED A PODCASE BECAUSE ITS A BETTER WAY TO COMMUNICATE ABOUT A TOPIC AT ANY GIVEN TIME OF DAY USING A PODCAST FOR A PLATFORM IS MUCH EASIER BECAUSE EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD CAN TUNE IN AND LISTING TO WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT .IT CAN HELP THE YOUTH TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF DIFFERENT THINGS GOING ON AROUND THE WORLD .THERE ARE A FEW REASONS WHY I CHOSE  TO DO A PODCAST FIRST PEOPLE CAN HEAR REAL LIFE STORIES FROM REAL PEOPLE AND UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE NOT ALONE SECOND TO HELP THEM IDENTIFY WITH CERTAIN SITUATIONS THIRD IT CAN KEEP KIDS FROM MAKING THE SAME MISTAKES BY LISTENING TO DIFFERENT EVENTS FOURTH IT CAN HELP KIDS FOCUS MORE ON THEIR GOALS IN LIFE .SUGGESTIONS EVERYDAY FROM 4 TO 5PM DIFFERENT TOPICS WOULD BE DISCUSSED REGARDING GUN VIOLENCE >HAVEING A STREET TEAM TO GO OUT IN THE COMMUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES TO STOP THE VIOLENCE.HAVEING A PLACE WHERE KIDS COULD COME AND LISTEN TO OUR BROADCAST.AFTER SCHOOL TUTORING MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING ONE ON ONE SESSIONS AND SPORT ACTIVITES
